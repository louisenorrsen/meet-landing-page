## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned that z-index is not as simple that the element with the highest z-index is on top of all the layers. 
I also have learned how to make pseudo elements with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [The Stacking Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) - This helped me for learning the stacking context to use z-index in a better way.
- [Pseudo Elements explained by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI&t=0s) - This is an YouTube video in three parts that explains ::before and ::after.
